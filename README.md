# Project in Image Processing and Computer Vision

## Introduction
The field of computer vision is revolutionizing the way machines interact with the visual world. Through this project, students will engage with fundamental techniques in image classification, applying machine learning models to real-world datasets. This will provide hands-on experience in both developing and deploying classifiers that can discern between different categories of objects in images.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into several phases, each designed to deepen your understanding and skills in computer vision:

1. **Dataset Selection**: Choose one of the provided datasets for image classification. Each dataset has unique characteristics and challenges:
   - Dataset A: [Description of Dataset A]
   - Dataset B: [Description of Dataset B]
   - Dataset C: [Description of Dataset C]
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure, features, and the challenges it presents. Document your findings and initial thoughts on how to approach the classification problem.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Preprocess the images to get them ready for training.
   - Select and apply a machine learning algorithm to build a classifier. You can use frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
   - Train your model and optimize its parameters to achieve the best performance.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Validate your model using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
   - Discuss the performance of your model and any potential biases or limitations.

5. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Deploy your model as a simple web application or a script that can take an image input and output a classification.
   - You can use streamlit + Flask for this, for example

## Resources

- TensorFlow: [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- PyTorch: [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)
- Scikit-Learn for preprocessing tools: [https://scikit-learn.org/](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## Deliverables

1. **Python Code:** Provide well-documented Python code that conducts the analysis.
2. **Report**: Submit a detailed report documenting your EDA findings, model development process, evaluation metrics, and conclusions about the model's performance.
3. **Presentation**: Prepare a short presentation that overviews your project, from the dataset analysis to the final model evaluation. Include visual aids such as charts, model diagrams, and example predictions.

## Bonus

- Implement data augmentation techniques to improve your model's robustness.
- Compare the performance of at least three different models or architectures.
- Provide an interactive demo of your model during the presentation.
